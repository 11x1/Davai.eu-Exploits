# exercise exploits
These scripts were all figured out over a time period of 1-2 hours

- `kirjuta_sona.js` - automatically enter characters to complete the exercise
- `kummel.js` - we found that an html element's attribute stores the mistake count, script changes the mistake count. Also seems like to check the if the user did too many mistakes they used something similar to `if ( mistakes == 0 ) { ... }` instead of `if ( mistakes <= 0 ) { ... }` which allows for negative amount of mistakes to be valid.
- `leia_paar.js` - changed russian text cards' innerText to estonian to make the exercise as easy as possible
- `skrembl.js` - shows the correct letter under input box
- `test.js` - magic to this day, changing the failed/error text class to something different just breaks the whole logic and you could just press enter to solve the exercise
