- `background.js`  - injects code from `inject.js` into the site
- `hello.html`     - (iirc) needed html file for the extension to work
- `inject.js`      - main script that executed code from `all.js` which contained all `exercise exploits` files merged into one, with checks to what url the user is on to execute wanted exercise automation code
- `manifest.json`  -
- `popup.html`     - html site for the extension popup, with fields to change what categories and lessons to automatically complete
- `popup.js`       - middleman script between the extension and `inject.js`, to share user settings set in `popup.html`
