# exploits
**Functions like these should never be exposed to the end user!**
All of these functions were taken straight from the site's `<script>` tags

- `changeProfilePicture.js` - change profile picture of any user based on their userid, added a file input to the site to make this work
- `createGroup.js` - able to create a group with a provided name (don't know what g_group was used for), if all went we'll, script will print out the group code which is shareable to any user
- `deleteStudent.js` - delete a student with their respective userid and group code (iirc it was group code) (why was this in `<scirpt>` tags I don't know)
- `joinGroup.js` - force an user to join a group based on their userid and the group's code
- `updateProfile.js` - I think this only worked when an user was logged in but bypassed all confimations/verifications (if there even were any), this resulted in being able to change the Demo account names and passwords
